## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
- The company wants to know: 1.Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes 2.How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market.The dataset consists of 16 attributes

## Conclusions
- Temperature: As the temperature increases the count of bike rental increases and for cold temperature there is a decline in count of bike rental.It is the most significant variable affecting the demand for shared bikes
- Year: Year has positive coefficient. In 2019, there is a significant increase in demand compared to 2018 
- Weather: Higher bike rentals are observed when the weather is clear and sunny.Demand decline if weather is Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
- Season:Spring Season has a negative impact on demand. Bike reservations peak during the Summer and Fall seasons and are at their lowest during Spring.
- windspeed: Increase in winspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers
- Workingday: The majority of bike rentals occur on working days. Increase in workingdy variable increases the bike hire numbers
- Weekday: Day6 or Saturday has highest demand out of non working days
- Month: Month variable is significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
